<h2>PixArt</h2>
<b>Sandbox Clone</b> is an iOS app that was created as a clone of an existing app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/sandbox-pixel-art-colouring/id1237405816">Sandbox</a> from AppStore for my self-educational purposes.
The app contains a gallery of pictures that can be colored by numbers. This enjoyable task is a perfect activity for relaxation  and stress relief. It can provide the following <b>benefits</b>:<br>
• The structured nature of coloring by numbers requires attention to detail and concentration. This can help <strong><em>improve users' focus and their ability to complete tasks with precision</em></strong>.<br>
• For children and adults alike, coloring by numbers can help <strong><em>improve fine motor skills</em></strong>.
The precise movements required to color within lines and follow the numbers can <strong><em>enhance hand-eye coordination and dexterity</em></strong>.<br>
• For younger users, coloring by numbers can be an educational tool. It can help them <strong><em>learn numbers, colors, and patterns in a fun and engaging way</em></strong>.
Additionally, it can introduce them to concepts of art and design.<br>
